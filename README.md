## Description

### META-ST-X-LINUX-GNSS1 software features:

Its main feature are :

meta-st-x-linux-gnss1: Yocto Recipe for Reading NMEA GNSS data and enabling IMU and Environmental Sensors
meta-st-x-linux-gnss1-rtklib : Yocto Recipe for Enabling Real Time Kinematics (RTK) data using RTCM Messages on Teseo-LIV3F module board

### META-ST-X-LINUX-GNSS1 Architecture:

The software uses the OpenSTLinux UART and I2C Driver to interact with the Teseo-LIV3FL GNSS modules on X-STM32MP-GNSS1 board.
for meta-st-x-linux-gnss1  : The Yocto recipe creates the gnss_app application as a part of system image which can be flashed to the STM32MPU 
for meta-st-x-linux-gnss1-rtklib  : The Yocto recipe creates the RTK lib application along with the QT based application as a part of system image which can be flashed to the STM32MPU

## Hardware Setup:

The current package provides software support for the following boards
 - [X-STM32MP-GNSSx board mounted on STM32MP157F-DK2](https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-stm32mp-gnss1.html) based on Teseo-LIV3FL or Teseo-LIV4FL. 
 - The board is also compatible with X-NUCLEO-GNSSx and X-NUCLEO-LIV* boards plugged to the Arduino Connectors

## Software Setup:

The section describes the software setup that is required for building, flashing, deploying, and running the application.

### Recommended PC prerequisites

A Linux® PC running Ubuntu® 20.04 or 22.04 is recommended. Developers can follow the link below for details.
https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/PC_prerequisites

Follow the instructions on the ST wiki page [Image flashing](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32MP15_Discovery_kits_-_Starter_Package#Image_flashing) to prepare a bootable SD card with the starter package.  
Alternatively, a Windows / Mac computer can also be used; in that case, the following tools would be useful:
- Use [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) to flash the OpenSTLinux started package image onto the SD card
- Use [TeraTerm](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/osdn-download/releases/) or [PuTTY](https://putty.org/) to access the console interface via USB
- Use [winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) to copy the application to the MPU board

*The following conventions are used when referring to the code instructions.*

### Deploying the files to the MPU board

It is required to transfer the built binaries, Python scripts, and application resources to the STM32MP board from the development PC.

The resources can be transferred via any of the following methods:

1. **Using a network connection**

Refer to [How to Transfer a File Over a Network](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_transfer_a_file_over_network)
 
To connect the MPU board to a network, you may connect it to a wired network via the Ethernet jack on the MPU board.  
 
**OR**  

To connect to a WLAN, refer to [How to Setup a WLAN Connection"](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_setup_a_WLAN_connection)

2. **Using a serial protocol** (like zmodem from Teraterm or kermit)

For Linux hosts refer to [How to transfer a file over a serial console](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_transfer_a_file_over_serial_console)  
For Windows hosts, refer to
[How to transfer files to Discovery kit using Tera Term](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_transfer_files_to_Discovery_kit_using_Tera_Term_on_Windows_PC)

To evaluate the X-LINUX-GNSS1 package quickly, developers may copy the contents of the "application/Binaries" folder contained in the package to `/usr/local/demo/application` folder on the STM32MP board using any of the above methods.

```bash
# Go to the application folder and scp/push the binary to STM32MPU using zmodem or scp command
Then execute the below command in the STM32MPU
Board>$ chmod +x <binary_name>
# Run the binary
Board>$ ./<binary_name>
```
